# k-disks

This project was developed for a master thesis with the objective of developing a novel approach of solving three missions reguarding the target detection. It takes into consideration a set of sensors/agents/robots to perform three different missions in a known region of interest. The presented code was developed in matlab.

The project is divided in three directories:

-The Patrol_parameter_analysis has a group of simulations where the result of using different parameters is studied.

-The Tracking_examples directory gives examples for the tracking of intruders with different trajectories.

-The code directory has the code developed in matlab.

Finally, a pdf file "extended_abstract" with further information about the developed approach is given.

## Patrol_parameter_analysis & Tracking_examples

To better understand the reasoning behind the different parameter and the different trajectories for the targets we referenciate to the pdf file "extended_abstract" and to the thesis: https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/cursos/meaer/dissertacao/1972678479054156.

Each directory has a "info.txt" file where information regarding the simulations results and parameters are found. 

For tracking, the parameters used are always the same: m=50, n=75, alpha=0.7, d_j=10m and N=1000.
